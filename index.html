                <div><h2><strong>1. What is falcon heavy?</strong></h2>        
    <p>It's the heaviest rocket created by Spacex. It's also part of the grander plan for landing humans and cargo on the Moon and, eventually, on Mars. SpaceX have been developing their own spacecraft, Starship, to work in conjunction with the Falcon Heavy rockets, which will help NASA complete their first manned mission to the Moon since 1972.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)></a>Orion 1</a>, the model of a capsule taken by falcon heavy was recently used on a test conducted by NASA on the mission  <a href=https://www.nasa.gov/artemis-1/</a> Arthemis 1 </a>as part of the knowledge exchanges between NASA and Spacex.</p>

 <ul><li><b>November 2022</b>🌏
<ul>
    <li>Spacex uses Falcon Heavy to launch USSF-44 on a classified mission for the United States Space Force. There were 2 payloads on board this mission, a larger, unconfirmed satellite and a micro-satellite created to guide missiles called TETRA-1. </li></ul></li></ul><br>

    <li>
        <p>Falcon Heavy is composed of three reusable Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIPLmZK3C1Y</a> merlin engines</a> together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. As one of the world’s most powerful operational rockets, Falcon Heavy can lift nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lbs) to orbit.</li></p>
<br>
<p>
    <li> Merlins are not the most porwerful engines though. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7MQb9Y4FAE</a>Raptor engines </a> generate  1650KN of thurst at sea level while Merlin engines generate 845KN of thrust at sea level. Spacex conducted the most powerfull test of a rocket ever last year with raptor engines, in order to proceed with the plan of generating enought thurst to take a tripulation to mars.</li></p>

The calculation of orbit, speed, fuel tank, and the thurst during the landing is <span style="color:rgb(124, 124, 224)">AI powered</span> in order to minimize risks via multiple linear regretions.

<p><ul><li><b> The<a href=https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/cryogenic-advantage/article5596577.eceThe</a> Cryogenic Fuel</b></a> used by Falcon heavy originaly was composed by liquid methane and liquid oxygen ("methalox"). Cryogenic fuels are fuels that require storage at extremely low temperatures in order to maintain them in a liquid state and the state is obtained via condensation. when the valve is open, liquid oxygen from one tank meets liquid metane and the fire is ignited on merlin engines. The rocket doesn't explodes because of the aerodynamics of the nozzle( a exhaust pipe located at the bottom of the rocket ). It expands the gases releasing the extra pressure and sending the rocket up as decribed by newton's 3rd law. </p></li></ul></div><br>

<!--h4 = Thrust. What lifts the rocket-->                
<h5><strong>4. Thurst</strong></h5>
<div><p> According newton's 3rd law,where F=ma.</p>
    <br>
 <p>In case of a rocket pressure(P) and other factors are added, so the  thrust formula is F = m Ve + (Pe - P0) Ae . The thrust equation is imoprtant to calcuate the amount of fuel the rocket needs to go, for example, to the moon and return. The nozzle(exhaustion pipe) of the rocket acts as a valve to expand the gases of the cryogenic fuel, releasing it with the right amount of pressure without blowing up the rocket. That's why the nozzle has that format, the aerodynamics follows what is required for the rocket to go up. </p>
